------------------------------INSTRUCTIONS-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install the mod just go to your mount and blade warband local files ( C: > Program Files(x86) > 
Mount&Blade Warband) and drag the  enbseries.ini                d3d9.dll   effect.txt         
files.  The enbpalette.map files give the main color to M&B, you must drag the one you like also to the main directory ( I recomend to use the one already given). To use other palettes you must name it "enbpalette" and drag it to the M&B directory.


To activate the enb in game you must press shift + f12 and again to deactivate. You may change the settings in the enb.ini file and in the effect.txt file

To make the game look lest bright press shift + f9


Hope you guys enjoy!!!!!!!
